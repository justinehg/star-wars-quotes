# STAR WARS QUOTES
# Description:
Create a simple CRUD app that let user submit the infamous quotes from Star Wars, especially from the one and only: Yoda.

# Tech Used: 
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

Lessons Learned:
- Install Node, Nodemon (automatically restart server), and Express and coordinate them with the project
- How to create a datebase via MongoDB Atlas. 
I also learned the process of CRUD from building this mini project as well as how EJS play a role in rendering the submitted quotes onto the webpage.
